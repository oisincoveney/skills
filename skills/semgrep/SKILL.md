description: >-
  Run Semgrep static analysis scan on a codebase using parallel workers.
  Supports two scan modes — "run all" (full ruleset coverage) and "important
  only" (high-confidence security vulnerabilities). Automatically detects and
  uses Semgrep Pro for cross-file taint analysis when available. Use when asked
  to scan code for vulnerabilities, run a security audit with Semgrep, find
  bugs, or perform static analysis. Spawns parallel workers for multi-language
  codebases.

# Semgrep Security Scan

Run a Semgrep scan with automatic language detection, parallel execution, and merged SARIF output.

## Harness Note

This skill is written for any agent harness that can run shell commands and, ideally, parallel isolated workers. When examples mention tasks, workers, or scanner prompts, map them to your harness's equivalent mechanism. If no parallel worker mechanism exists, run the scanner prompts sequentially and state that the run is degraded.

## Essential Principles

1. **Always use `--metrics=off`** — Semgrep sends telemetry by default; `--config auto` also phones home. Every `semgrep` command must include `--metrics=off` to prevent data leakage during security audits.
2. **User must approve the scan plan (Step 3 is a hard gate)** — The original "scan this codebase" request is NOT approval. Present exact rulesets, target, engine, and mode; wait for explicit "yes"/"proceed" before spawning scanners.
3. **Third-party rulesets are required, not optional** — Trail of Bits, 0xdea, and Decurity rules catch vulnerabilities absent from the official registry. Include them whenever the detected language matches.
4. **Start all scan workers together when your harness supports it** — Parallel execution is the core performance advantage. Do not serialize independent language scans unless the harness lacks parallel workers.
5. **Always check for Semgrep Pro before scanning** — Pro enables cross-file taint tracking and catches ~250% more true positives. Skipping the check means silently missing critical inter-file vulnerabilities.

## When to Use

- Security audit of a codebase
- Finding vulnerabilities before code review
- Scanning for known bug patterns
- First-pass static analysis

## When NOT to Use

- Binary analysis → Use binary analysis tools
- Already have Semgrep CI configured → Use existing pipeline
- Need cross-file analysis but no Pro license → Consider CodeQL as alternative
- Creating custom Semgrep rules → Use `semgrep-rule-creator` skill
- Porting existing rules to other languages → Use `semgrep-rule-variant-creator` skill

## Output Directory

All scan results, SARIF files, and temporary data are stored in a single output directory.

- **If the user specifies an output directory** in their prompt, use it as `OUTPUT_DIR`.
- **If not specified**, default to `./static_analysis_semgrep_1`. If that already exists, increment to `_2`, `_3`, etc.

In both cases, **always create the directory** with `mkdir -p` before writing any files.

```bash
# Resolve output directory
if [ -n "$USER_SPECIFIED_DIR" ]; then
  OUTPUT_DIR="$USER_SPECIFIED_DIR"
else
  BASE="static_analysis_semgrep"
  N=1
  while [ -e "${BASE}_${N}" ]; do
    N=$((N + 1))
  done
  OUTPUT_DIR="${BASE}_${N}"
fi
mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR/raw" "$OUTPUT_DIR/results"
```

The output directory is resolved **once** at the start of Step 1 and used throughout all subsequent steps.

```
$OUTPUT_DIR/
├── rulesets.txt                 # Approved rulesets (logged after Step 3)
├── raw/                         # Per-scan raw output (unfiltered)
│   ├── python-python.json
│   ├── python-python.sarif
│   ├── python-django.json
│   ├── python-django.sarif
│   └── ...
└── results/                     # Final merged output
    └── results.sarif
```

## Prerequisites

**Required:** Semgrep CLI (`semgrep --version`). If not installed, see [Semgrep installation docs](https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/).

**Optional:** Semgrep Pro — enables cross-file taint tracking, inter-procedural analysis, and additional languages (Apex, C#, Elixir). Check with:

```bash
semgrep --pro --validate --config p/default 2>/dev/null && echo "Pro available" || echo "OSS only"
```

**Limitations:** OSS mode cannot track data flow across files. Pro mode uses `-j 1` for cross-file analysis (slower per ruleset, but parallel rulesets compensate).

## Scan Modes

Select mode in Step 2 of the workflow. Mode affects both scanner flags and post-processing.

| Mode | Coverage | Findings Reported |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Run all** | All rulesets, all severity levels | Everything |
| **Important only** | All rulesets, pre- and post-filtered | Security vulns only, medium-high confidence/impact |

**Important only** applies two filter layers:
1. **Pre-filter**: `--severity MEDIUM --severity HIGH --severity CRITICAL` (CLI flag)
2. **Post-filter**: JSON metadata — keeps only `category=security`, `confidence∈{MEDIUM,HIGH}`, `impact∈{MEDIUM,HIGH}`

See [scan-modes.md](references/scan-modes.md) for metadata criteria and jq filter commands.

## Workflow

**Follow the detailed workflow in [scan-workflow.md](workflows/scan-workflow.md).** Summary:

| Step | Action | Gate | Key Reference |
|------|--------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Resolve output dir, detect languages + Pro availability | — | Use file-search tools before shell fallbacks |
| 2 | Select scan mode + rulesets | — | [rulesets.md](references/rulesets.md) |
| 3 | Present plan, get explicit approval | ⛔ HARD | Ask the user directly |
| 4 | Start parallel scan workers | — | [scanner-task-prompt.md](references/scanner-task-prompt.md) |
| 5 | Merge results and report | — | Merge script (below) |

**Workflow enforcement:** Track the 5 steps with explicit dependencies. Step 3 is a HARD GATE — mark it complete ONLY after user explicitly approves.

**Merge command (Step 5):**

```bash
uv run {baseDir}/scripts/merge_sarif.py $OUTPUT_DIR/raw $OUTPUT_DIR/results/results.sarif
```

## Workers

| Worker | Capability | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `semgrep-scanner` | Shell command execution | Executes semgrep scans for a language category |

Use the scanner prompt in [scanner-task-prompt.md](references/scanner-task-prompt.md) for each language category.

## Rationalizations to Reject

| Shortcut | Why It's Wrong |
|----------|----------------|
| "User asked for scan, that's approval" | Original request != plan approval. Present plan and await explicit "yes" |
| "Step 3 is blocking, just mark complete" | Lying about status defeats enforcement. Only mark complete after real approval |
| "I already know what they want" | Assumptions cause scanning wrong directories/rulesets. Present plan for verification |
| "Just use default rulesets" | User must see and approve exact rulesets before scan |
| "Add extra rulesets without asking" | Modifying approved list without consent breaks trust |
| "Third-party rulesets are optional" | Trail of Bits, 0xdea, Decurity catch vulnerabilities not in official registry — REQUIRED |
| "Use --config auto" | Sends metrics; less control over rulesets |
| "One worker at a time" | Defeats parallelism; start independent workers together when supported |
| "Pro is too slow, skip --pro" | Cross-file analysis catches 250% more true positives; worth the time |
| "Semgrep handles GitHub URLs natively" | URL handling fails on repos with non-standard YAML; always clone first |
| "Cleanup is optional" | Cloned repos pollute the user's workspace and accumulate across runs |
| "Use `.` or relative path as target" | Workers need absolute paths to avoid ambiguity |
| "Let the user pick an output dir later" | Output directory must be resolved at Step 1, before any files are created |
