description: Use for hard bugs and performance regressions — when the bug is intermittent, the cause is unknown, or "reproduce it" is itself the hard part. A disciplined loop — build a fast deterministic feedback signal → reproduce → 3–5 falsifiable hypotheses → instrument one variable at a time → fix with a regression test → post-mortem. Trigger on "diagnose this", "why is this flaky", "intermittent", "perf regression", "can't reproduce", "it works sometimes".

# Diagnose

A discipline for the bugs that don't yield to a quick read. [[trace]] is the stance — don't guess, find the root cause, trace the bad value back to its origin. This skill is what you run when the *reproduce-it* step is itself the hard part: the bug is intermittent, environment-specific, or slow to surface. Skip a phase only when you can say out loud why.

## Phase 1 — Build a feedback loop

**This is the skill. Everything else is mechanical.** Give yourself a fast, deterministic, agent-runnable pass/fail signal for the bug and you *will* find the cause — bisection, hypothesis-testing, and instrumentation all just consume that signal. Without one, no amount of staring at code saves you. Spend disproportionate effort here. Be aggressive, be creative, refuse to give up.

Ways to build one, roughly easiest-first:

1. A **failing test** at whatever seam reaches the bug.
2. A **curl / HTTP script** against a running dev server.
3. A **CLI invocation** on a fixture, diffing stdout against a known-good snapshot.
4. A **headless-browser script** (Playwright/Puppeteer) asserting on DOM/console/network.
5. **Replay a captured trace** — save a real request/payload/event log, replay it through the code path in isolation.
6. A **throwaway harness** — a minimal subset of the system, one function call that hits the bug path.
7. A **property / fuzz loop** for "sometimes wrong output" — 1000 random inputs, look for the failure mode.
8. A **bisection harness** — automate "boot at state X, check, repeat" so `git bisect run` can drive it.
9. A **differential loop** — same input through old vs new (or two configs), diff the outputs.

Then treat the loop as a product: make it **faster** (cache setup, narrow scope), **sharper** (assert the specific symptom, not "didn't crash"), and **more deterministic** (pin the clock, seed the RNG, isolate the filesystem). A 2-second deterministic loop is a superpower; a 30-second flaky one is barely better than nothing.

**Non-deterministic bugs:** the goal isn't a clean repro, it's a *higher reproduction rate*. Loop the trigger 100×, parallelise, add stress, narrow timing windows, inject sleeps. A 50%-flake is debuggable; 1% is not — raise the rate until it is.

**If you genuinely cannot build a loop,** stop and say so. List what you tried, and ask for the missing piece: access to the env that reproduces it, a captured artifact (HAR, log dump, core dump, timestamped recording), or permission for temporary instrumentation. Do **not** hypothesise without a loop.

## Phase 2 — Reproduce

Run the loop, watch the bug appear, and confirm it's *the user's* bug — the failure they described, not a different one nearby. Wrong bug → wrong fix. Capture the exact symptom (message, wrong output, timing) so later phases can prove the fix addresses it.

## Phase 3 — Hypothesise

Write **3–5 ranked, falsifiable hypotheses before testing any of them** — single-hypothesis generation anchors on the first plausible idea. Each must state a prediction: *"If X is the cause, then changing Y makes it disappear / Z makes it worse."* Can't state the prediction? It's a vibe — sharpen or discard it. Show the ranked list to the user before testing; they often re-rank it instantly ("we just deployed #3"). Don't block on it if they're away — proceed with your ranking.

## Phase 4 — Instrument

Each probe maps to one prediction. **Change one variable at a time.** Prefer a debugger/REPL breakpoint over ten logs; targeted logs at the boundaries that distinguish hypotheses over "log everything and grep". **Tag every debug log** with a unique prefix (`[DEBUG-a4f2]`) so cleanup is a single grep. For **performance** regressions, logs are usually wrong: establish a baseline measurement (timing harness, profiler, query plan), then bisect. Measure first, fix second.

## Phase 5 — Fix + regression test

Write the regression test **before** the fix — *if there is a correct seam* for it, one where the test exercises the real bug pattern as it occurs at the call site. A too-shallow seam (a single-caller unit test for a bug that needs multiple callers) gives false confidence; if no correct seam exists, **that is the finding** — note it, the architecture is preventing the bug from being locked down, and hand it to [[improve]]. If a seam exists: turn the minimised repro into a failing test, watch it fail, apply the fix per [[fix]], watch it pass, then re-run the Phase 1 loop against the *original* scenario. (This is [[test]]'s reproduce-before-you-fix, applied to a hard bug.)

## Phase 6 — Cleanup + post-mortem

- [ ] Original repro no longer reproduces (re-run the loop).
- [ ] Regression test passes — or its absence is documented.
- [ ] All `[DEBUG-…]` instrumentation removed (grep the prefix).
- [ ] Throwaway prototypes deleted or clearly quarantined.
- [ ] The hypothesis that proved correct is written into the commit / PR message — the next debugger inherits it.

Then ask: **what would have prevented this?** If the answer is architectural — no good seam, tangled callers, hidden coupling — hand off to [[improve]] with specifics, *after* the fix is in, when you know the most.

## The short version

Build a fast deterministic feedback loop — that's 90% of it. Reproduce the *real* bug. 3–5 falsifiable hypotheses before testing. Instrument one variable at a time, tagged. Regression-test at a correct seam (or flag its absence). Clean up, and write down the hypothesis that won.
